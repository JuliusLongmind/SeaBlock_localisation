These would include the Spawner, an Ender Hopper to suck items into the Dimensional Transciever, which provides energy to the spawner, and send items to your storage.  Create a Reinforced Obsidian casing around your machines.  Think of your Forcefield setup as a peach, with a hard pit in the middle that contains your vital machines.\n§1Tip: Wither blasts go through block corners, so make sure the walls are squared at the edges.
mypack.quest420.name=Test It Out
mypack.quest420.desc=Test out your forcefield by lassoing a few mobs into it... make sure they can't escape, are taking damage appropriately, and your Forcicium power is flowing smoothly. §1 It is VITAL that you monitor your Forcicium system closely... allowing the forcefield to fall off, while the spawner is still running, is sure to spell destruction for your world as Withers escape.
mypack.quest421.name=Yeta Nother Wrench
mypack.quest421.desc=The rf powered MFFS Multi-Tool wrench has multiple functions which can be cycled through by sneak+right clicking in the air.  Wrench mode will enable to you turn machines, while switch mode will toggle the machine on and off, if the machine is set to respond to that in the GUI.\n§1This Tip Sheet should help clarify some of the GUI aspects of the MFFS Machines.
mypack.quest422.name=MFFS Capacitor
mypack.quest422.desc=The MFFS capacitor excepts Forcicium energy from the Extractor and stores it... able to disperse it to other machines as needed.  MFFS does not use "Cables".  Forcicium is transferred between machines using MFFS Cards.  Simply right click a blank MFFS card on the Capacitor, then place the card into the Extractor.  Make sure a lever is toggled on to enable the machine.
mypack.quest423.name=MFFS
mypack.quest423.desc=The Modular Forcefield System (MFFS) can create protected/contained areas using unbreakable forcefields that even the Wither can't penetrate.  The energy that powers this system is Forcicium.  The Extractor machine will use a bit of rf/t to extract Forcicium energy from the crystals, and send it to a Capacitor to be used in other machines.\n§1Tip: EnderIO conduits and capacitors seem to disagree with the MFFS extractor, so try using a Power Cell next to the extractor to provide it energy.
mypack.quest424.name=Forcefield Type
mypack.quest424.desc=So now you know how to control the size of your forcefield.  The Containment Module denotes the type of forcefield.  This type will not allow any entities/projectiles/explosions to escape.  Lastly, the Mob Killer upgrade will make the forcefield damage all mobs that are contained within... killing a Wither in about 20 seconds or so.  All mobs contained, will take damage at the same time.
mypack.quest425.name=Customizing Your Field
mypack.quest425.desc=The size, position, and type of forecield you project are controlled by the different upgrades you place into the projector GUI.  The §1Focus upgrades will expand the field on the X and Y axes§r... basically making your field wider. §2The Field Strength Upgrade will expand your field on the Z axis§r, giving it depth, and creating a cube when used with the Focus Upgrades.  §4The Distance upgrades control how far in front of the projector your forcefield starts.
mypack.quest426.name=Anchors Up
mypack.quest426.desc=Travel Anchors will also allow you to teleport between them without the Staff of Travelling if the two anchors are within 50 blocks of each other.
mypack.quest427.name=Litherite
mypack.quest427.desc=In Environmental Tech Higher Tier Multiblocks require more power to operate but produce higher outputs, faster.  Each tier of Void Miner will give you a plethora of ore materials, and also the Crystals needed to make the higher tiers of miner.  Even so, the base crafting crystals for each tier are slow to come by.  You will want to plan on supplementing your Void Miner's acquisition of crystals with some Gil Trades from the merchants.
mypack.quest428.name=Project Projection
mypack.quest428.desc=The Projector is the heart of the MFFS system, it is the block that actually projects your forcefield into the world.  It has a somewhat complicated GUI, so refer to this handy guide for further details.  The Projector needs to be linked to the Capacitor like other machines, using a blank  MFFS card.
mypack.quest429.name=A Structured Block
mypack.quest429.desc=Strucutre blocks come in 6 tiers, each corresponding to the tiers of multi-blocks they help form.  You will need a LOT of these as you build higher tier machinery.  Keep in mind though, if you have set up automation to create shipments for trade with your local Gil merchants, you can purchase many of these components.
mypack.quest430.name=Fighting Back
mypack.quest430.desc=The Ender Sword and Bow are the strongest weapons you will find... if you mean to confront every meanie that comes along your journey, then you will need this pair to do it with.\n\nThe Ender Mk2 also has a high beheading chance.
mypack.quest431.name=Dimensional Transceiver
mypack.quest431.desc=The Dimensional Transceiver is a wireless and cross-dimensional way to transport energy, fluids, and items.  The GUI will allow you to set up channels, which are linked between any other Transceivers set to that same channel.  This will be very important in setups going forward, including your Wither farm.
mypack.quest432.name=Enderoomba
mypack.quest432.desc=The Vacuum Chest will suck items within huge 24 block radius into it's buffer.  Works great for mob farms where explosions aren't a factor.
mypack.quest433.name=XP Sucker
mypack.quest433.desc=The XP Vacuum is similar to the Vacuum chest in that it has a huge 24 block radius for collecting XP orbs and storing them as a fluid which can be extracted later.
mypack.quest434.name=New Toys
mypack.quest434.desc=This next section of tasks will introduce you to a few of the new gadgets available to you now that you have the Futuretech table.  The Enchanter is a podium which will allow you to select the exact enchants you are interested in, no longer relying on the random vanilla enchanter.
mypack.quest435.name=Combo Arrays
mypack.quest435.desc=Your Solar Arrays can be made up of any combination of solar array panels.  Each Solar Array Panel produces a certain amount of RF, and the combined total of all panels will be your total array output.  §1Higher Tier Controllers are more efficient.  So full Litherite cells on a Tier 1 array only produce 549rf/t while full Litherite cells on a Tier 6 array produce 332,254rf/t.  With enough resources you can eventually have full Aethium cells on a Tier 6 array producing 1.8milllon rf/t
mypack.quest436.name=Pump It Up
mypack.quest436.desc=While there are no infinite water machines available at this stage of the game, you can use the Water Pump to help in your automations.  Place it right above a body of water, and use a lever to give it a redstone signal.  It will fill adjacent tanks.  §4\n§1Tip:  Fluid dials can be slapped on the front of most fluid containers to give you information at a quick glance.
mypack.quest437.name=Tier 2 Power
mypack.quest437.desc=You will need to do quite a bit of Void Mining to secure the materials needed for a Tier 2 Solar and even more for the higher tiers.  Revisit these quests when you can.  \n\nA Tier 2 Solar Array with full Erodium cells can produce up to 4075rf/t
mypack.quest438.name=Starting From The Bottom
mypack.quest438.desc=As you will see with most Environmental Tech multi-blocks, you have to work your way up through the tiers, as each one requires crystals or blocks from the previous tier.  The Tier 1 Solar Array does not produce a huge amount of power, but it is the first step to reaching higher tiers which will eventually outperform the Diesel Generator and Steam Turbine combined.
mypack.quest439.name=Building Buddy
mypack.quest439.desc=The Assembler is a nifty wand that will allow you to erect structures without having to place each block.  Simply place the controller for the machine type you are building, making sure to leave space above or below it, as noted in the Guide you received.  Ensure you have the blocks needed to form the structure, then right click the controller repeatedly with the Assembler.
mypack.quest440.name=Tier 2 Solar Array
mypack.quest440.desc=The Tier 2 Solar Array requires 25 panels
mypack.quest441.name=Tier 3 Solar Array
mypack.quest441.desc=The Tier 3 Solar Array requires 49 panels.
mypack.quest442.name=Piezo Modifiers
mypack.quest442.desc=Your Solar Arrays have decreased efficiency when it's raining or night time.  Piezo Modifiers increase the functionality of your Solar Arrays while it's raining.  Though each Piezo Modifier only increases the efficiency by a small percentage... so higher tier solar arrays, that have more modifier slots, will retain the most efficiency in bad weather.\n§1Tip: Not all modifiers work on all multiblocks.  Even though they can be installed, if they aren't compatible, they will have no effect.
mypack.quest443.name=Tier 3 Solar Power
mypack.quest443.desc=A Tier 3 Solar Array with  full Kyronite panels can produce up to 24,000rf/t
mypack.quest444.name=Building An Economy
mypack.quest444.desc=There is a bustling community of merchants who thrive on the trade of goods between different outposts.  You can participate in this barter, gaining Gil and providing a means to purchase many supplies to advance your technology.  What do you have to trade?  Fruits, Vegetables, and Mob Drops primarily.  \n§1Tip:  Any 9 harvestcraft vegetables or fruits can be combined into Assorted Farm Goods.
mypack.quest445.name=Making It Easier
mypack.quest445.desc=You may want to set up Autocrafting with Applied Energistics later to make this process easier, however, in the mean time you can use Auto Crafters to create your Assorted Farm goods.  You will need one crafter for each combination of goods you plan to use.
mypack.quest446.name=Modifiers
mypack.quest446.desc=Every Multiblock can accept Modifiers.  Speed to decrease operation time, accuracy to increase lens percentages, etc...  Null Modifiers are the base component of these modifiers.  The higher the tier of multiblock, the more modifier slots it has.  Refer to your Environmental Tech guide for details.\n§4Tip: While you can craft Null Modifiers to fill empty upgrade spots, actual operational modifiers must be purchased from a sea merchant.
mypack.quest447.name=Reacting To Reactors
mypack.quest447.desc=There are two types of reactors in this chain, Passively Cooled and Actively Cooled.  Passively Cooled reactors are self-contained units that don't generate power themselves, albeit very low amounts of power.  Actively Cooled reactors generate steam, which is then passed into a Steam Turbine, which generates a lot more power.
mypack.quest448.name=Tier 3
mypack.quest448.desc=\n                            §1 This Tier Requires\n                       §2§r56x Tier 3 Structure Frames\n                           52x Structure Panels\n                             8x Modifier Slots\n                               4x Laser Cores
mypack.quest449.name=Tricksy Mices
mypack.quest449.desc=Rats are smart and tricky rodents... they have a terrible tendency to run around and get into trouble if you take your eyes off of them for a few seconds.  They have been known to crawl through the Hub Keyholes in your walls, dive into the moonpool, and crawl under any fences you erect.  You may want to "Rat Proof" your base a bit by covering your keyholes and moonpool drops with trap doors.
mypack.quest450.name=Tool Refilling
mypack.quest450.desc=The Mechanical Toolbox will store your extra Artisan Tools and automatically refill slots in attached tables when a tool is used up.
mypack.quest451.name=XP Juice
mypack.quest451.desc=With knowledge, comes power.  Experience, or "XP Juice" will fuel the vast majority of the crafts you will be performing using the Futuretech table.  You can squeeze XP from Assorted Farm Goods through a Magma Crucible.\n§1Tip:  Any 9 meat, vegetables, or fruit can be crafted into Assorted Farm Goods to be used in the magma crucible.  Consider setting up an autocrafter.
mypack.quest452.name=A Taste Of Whats To Come
mypack.quest452.desc=Soulsand and Magma blocks have the ability to suck and expel water in a column above them.  The Soul Sand will push players upwards and the Magma block will pull players down.  Use these to traverse to the Ocean Floor or Surface quickly.
mypack.quest453.name=Raking In The Goods
mypack.quest453.desc=You're going to be mass producing tons of small items to package them into shipping bins ready to be sold.  Few pipes or conduits can handle this level of transfer rate efficiently.  Use Translocators to move items a 1-block distance extremely fast.  §1Each of the rewards below can effect the behavior of your Translocators, try them out.  Note that right clicking Glowstone onto a translocator is especially effective at speeding up their transfer rate.
mypack.quest454.name=Compact Storage
mypack.quest454.desc=The Merchants can't accept a basket full of loose fruit... you must package your farm goods for sale.  Using a compactor you can compress 15 Assorted Farm Goods into a Farm Goods Crate.  From there, you can compact 15 Farm Good Crates into a Farm Good Bin, which you can then send through the Merchant Shipper in return for Gil.
mypack.quest455.name=Void Ore Miner Tier 1
mypack.quest455.desc=The Void Ore Miner will siphon ores of all types from the void.  Higher tiers are faster and pull in less Void Static - A useless biproduct of void mining, this material should be filtered out and destroyed.  You can purchase colored lenses from Sea Merchants that will allow you to hone in on certain ore types.\n                             The Tier Requires:\n                       24x Tier 2 Structure Frames\n                           20x Structure Panels\n                             0x Modifier Slots\n                               2x Laser Cores
mypack.quest456.name=Test Your Might
mypack.quest456.desc=You may feel like Shipping Bins should sell for more than 10 Gil each to villagers, but they know how efficient Mob Farms and Agricultural setups can be.  When you get a large automated set of farms running the Gil will start pouring in.
mypack.quest457.name=Tier 2
mypack.quest457.desc=\n                            §1 This Tier Requires\n                       §2§r32x Tier 2 Structure Frames\n                           16x Structure Panels\n                             4x Modifier Slots\n                               3x Laser Cores

mypack.quest461.name=Bit Coin Miner Tier 1
mypack.quest461.desc=The Bit Coin Miner uses a patented Gooch Algorithm to extract Bit Gil Coins from the Void.  An easy, set-it-and-forget-it way to accrue Gil to supplement your progression.  After Tier 3 you no longer siphon Void Static, making your Bit Coin Miner much more efficient.  At Tier 6, your miner will only target Nickels and higher, greatly increasing your yield.  \n                             §1The Tier Requires:\n                       §r24x Tier 2 Structure Frames\n                           20x Structure Panels\n                             0x Modifier Slots\n                               2x Laser Cores

mypack.quest494.name=Grinding It Out
mypack.quest494.desc=The Grindstone will assist you in making alloy blends.  It requires a crank in the top and must be turned manually, but it will suffice until you get powered automation.
mypack.quest495.name=Drill Instructor
mypack.quest495.desc=The fluxbore is a handy drill tool.  You may be familiar with drills already, however these have certain size capabilities that other versions do not.  While the basic version only performs in a 1x1 or 1x2 size range, higher tiers are much more useful, even clearing areas of 3x3x3 or 5x5.

mypack.quest526.name=She's A Brick House
mypack.quest526.desc=Besides their decorative flare, Caminite brick blocks will be used for most of your Ember Machinery.
mypack.quest527.name=Wide Receptor
mypack.quest527.desc=The Ember Receptor is placed on the input port of an Ember operated machine.  In order to link the Receptor with an Emitter you must shift+right click on the Receptor FIRST, then right click the Emitter.  Make sure the lever on the Emitter is turned on.
mypack.quest528.name=Activating Your Embers
mypack.quest528.desc=Your Water Strainer has likely sifted you a large number of ember shards from the surrounding ocean waters.  Gather these, as they will serve as the fuel for many of your machines.
mypack.quest529.name=One Ring To Hold Them All
mypack.quest529.desc=Caminite Rings stack on top of your Resevoir and Valve.  Aiming at the middle block of the ring below and placing the next, will create a strait column of rings.  Each ring adds 250 buckets worth of fluid capacity.  Stack them as high as you deem necessary.
mypack.quest530.name=Resevoir Dogs
mypack.quest530.desc=The resevoir doesn't do much on it's own.  You will need to add Caminite Rings to increase it's capacity.\n§1Tip:  The Resevoir is pretty large, taking up a footprint of 3x3 and extending as high as the number of rings you add to it.  Make some room.
mypack.quest531.name=Not The Gabe Newell One
mypack.quest531.desc=The Caminite Valve sits on top of the resevoir block and provides input and output ports for your fluid.
mypack.quest532.name=Hammers, The New Wrenches
mypack.quest532.desc=The Tinker's Hammer is similar in functionality to the wrenches used by other mods.  It allows you to adjust settings of in-world Embers objects.  Most notably it will allow you to link Ember Emitters with Ember Receivers.
mypack.quest533.name=I Must Emit
mypack.quest533.desc=The Ember Emitter is placed on one of the sides, on the top half of the Ember Activator. When Ember is fed to the Activator, it is burned and the Ember Emitter will then send the Ember Energy to an Ember Receptor it is linked to.
mypack.quest534.name=A Watched Engine Never Boils
mypack.quest534.desc=The mechanical output can be thought of like an automatic hand crank.  §4SNEAK+CLICKING a gearbox onto the output§r will allow any axles that extend from it to spin, creating power.  \n§1Tip:  This Tip Sheet will show you an example of a Power Train setup using a Steam Boiler and Steam Engine... the setup is even easier using the Ember Mechanic multiblock, since it produces it's own steam and replaces the boiler and steam engine.
mypack.quest535.name=Tanks For Nothin
mypack.quest535.desc=Your fluid holding options are a bit limited right now, but the Ember Fluid Tanks can hold 16 buckets.  More importantly, they are part of the Resevoir Multiblock, a fluid solution that can hold thousands of buckets worth of fluid.
mypack.quest536.name=Gil Trade
mypack.quest536.desc=Earn Gil by completing certain quests and Test Your Might feats.
mypack.quest537.name=Preparing To Leave
mypack.quest537.desc=You have come to the point in your journey when you have the option to leave this water-filled world, and travel to the lush green homelands you left so long ago.  It will require a enormous amount of power, materials, and coordination, but the end is in sight.  The Applied Energistics Spatial Storage system will allow you to capture very large areas, such as your base, and store it inside your network... then deploy it elsewhere.
mypack.quest538.name=Components
mypack.quest538.desc=There are three major components of the Spatial Storage system.  \n§1The Spatial I/O  - Similar to the Disk Drive, it holds the Spatial storage disk that contains your structure.\n§2§4Spatial Pylons - Are placed around your structure to designate the structure being copied or pasted.§5\nSpatial Storage Disks - Come in different sizes depending on the size of your structure, and are used in the Spatial I/O to store and deploy structures.
mypack.quest539.name=Size Matters
mypack.quest539.desc=The size of the Spatial Disk you need is dependant on the size of the structure you are storing.  Assuming you would like to relocate your base to a non-water filled dimension,  you will most likely need the 128^3 (128 blocks cubed) disk.  This will store everything... you guessed it... in an area up to 128 x 128 x 128.
mypack.quest540.name=Changing Channels
mypack.quest540.desc=The AE2 system can only transfer through so many channels at once.  8 to be exact.  Each major component of your network requires a channel.  Major Components include things such as Disk Drives, Terminals, Interfaces.  If you need more channels than that, which you likely will... you will need to bridge that section of channels to your main system using a controller.
mypack.quest541.name=An Energy Ambassador
mypack.quest541.desc=\nYour Applied Energistics storage system stores all of your items in the form of energy.  They are then insribed onto discs, and accessible anywhere with the proper upgrades.  The Energy Acceptor will convert Redstone Flux into the AE equivalent, allowing you to power your ME System from your normal power generation. \n
mypack.quest542.name=Connecting The Dots
mypack.quest542.desc=Now that your system is set up to recieve power, you need a way to transport that power.  ME Cables serve multiple purposes.  Not only do they transfer energy, but they also allow the dematerialized items in your storage to travel to and fro.\n§1Tip:  EnderIO also offers a compatable cable option for AE.
mypack.quest543.name=The Backup Plan
mypack.quest543.desc=It is always a good idea to keep a small capacitor of energy storage for your ME System in case there is a brief interruption in the power source.\n§6§1Tip:  If your system lacks power you will be able to click on the terminal, but it will appear dark and show no items.
mypack.quest544.name=The Face Of Applied Energistics
mypack.quest544.desc=The Access Terminal is your GUI for interacting with your storage system.  For now, it is a stationary panel that will give you access to deposit and withdraw items.  Craft some illuminated panels to get started.
mypack.quest545.name=ME Terminal Is You Terminal
mypack.quest545.desc=The basic ME Terminal is will give you access to your stored items for withdrawl and deposit.  It does not give you the function of crafting or pattern creation.\n§a§1Tip: You can change the color of your ME Terminal pattern by changing the color of the ME Glass Cable it is attached to!
mypack.quest546.name=All In One
mypack.quest546.desc=Combining a bit more technology and a Crafting Table into your ME Terminal will allow you to craft directly from the interface.  Keep in mind that this supports Auto-Fill from JEI. §6 §1Pressing the " + " button on the recipe screen will place the correct items from your ME Network into the crafting grid. §f It will continue to fill as you pull from the output.
mypack.quest547.name=Tricky Transformers
mypack.quest547.desc=Remember, you can view the diagram and parts for the schematic multiblock by "using" the blueprint in your hand.  The diagram for the Ember Engery Generator §c§1does not show the two Current Transformers that are placed on the leftmost and rightmost blocks of the machine.§r  They have been provided for you.
mypack.quest548.name=Shard Values
mypack.quest548.desc=The Ember Energy Generator requires 20 ember value each second.  There are three types of Ember chunks.  Each tier provides slightly more Ember Value in the Activator.  Ember Shards can be crafted into Ember Crystals for more efficiency; But Ember Clusters can only be obtained from the Ember Quarry.\n§dEmber Shard - 200 Ember Value\nEmber Crystal - 2400 Ember Value\nEmber Cluser - 3600 Ember Value
mypack.quest549.name=Receptionist
mypack.quest549.desc=As with the Ember Ore Factory, you will need to place an Ember Receptor on your Input Hatch and §6§1link it to an Ember Emitter with the Tinker's Hammer§r to recieve Ember Value.
mypack.quest550.name=Controll Your Currents
mypack.quest550.desc=You should already be familiar with using the Water Pump and Embers Receptor to power your multiblock, as it was the same system used for your Ember Ore Factory.  Perhaps your resevoir holds the water needed as well.\n§6Tip: Slap a Fluid Dial on you Fluid Input Hatch to view the contents.
mypack.quest551.name=Pure Or Convenient
mypack.quest551.desc=If you chose to automate your Purified Water production back when you gained access to the fluid funnel, then you may want to use that as coolant instead of plain water.  Purified Water uses half the mb and produces twice as much rf/t compare to plain water coolant.\n§6§1Tip: Slap an Ember Dial on your Ember Input Hatch to monitor it's contents.
mypack.quest552.name=Test Your Might - Ethanol
mypack.quest552.desc=§5§rOn each page you will find quests with a "fancy border".  These are §6§rTest Your Might Quests§r.  These §b§6§a§a§4OPTIONAL§r tasks will give you the opportunity to turn in items and resources in exchange for Gil currency.  §6§rGil can be used to purchase some convenient items on the Gil Exchange tab, or purchase goods from Deep Sea Villagers.
mypack.quest553.name=Shard Values
mypack.quest553.desc=Now that you are producing power, there are a couple things you will want to decide the priority on.  \n§6-You can begin Aquaculture for farm automation.\n§b-You can power the Fermenter, Core Sample Drills, and Pumpjacks needed to get Oil refining underway.\n§a-You can now charge Powercells, which will fuel your submarine, the Seamoth.. your ticket to exploring the dungeons and ruins around the ocean.
mypack.quest554.name=Ethanol Ethics
mypack.quest554.desc=While you are stockpiling Ethanol to be used in your upcoming Oil Processing, you may consider using it in your Ember Energy Generator.  It uses 200mb a second, but produces 512rf/t.
mypack.quest555.name=Project Projector
mypack.quest555.desc=The Projector you received can display a diagram of a Fermenter multiblock to build when you click it on the ground.   The Fermenter creates Ethanol from different vegetables... the most efficient of which is Corn.  You will need a constant supply of Ethanol for your Oil Processing, so it is advised you start fermenting corn now.
mypack.quest556.name=Connecting The Nubs
mypack.quest556.desc=You will gain access to more advanced wires and conduits later.  Until then craft connectors and wire coils to transfer energy by linking them with a hammer.  You can also use Capacitors to transport RF/t.  Click the sides of the capacitor with the Engineers Hammer to configure it's I/O.
mypack.quest557.name=Big Progress
mypack.quest557.desc=Build the Fermentor, set up your corn crops, and start pumping the power!  You have made the first step to mid game automation.  To celebrate, take this Hub Expansopn Key and make room for your new setup.\n§6Tip: You are crafting additional scaffolding that will be used further along.
mypack.quest558.name=Server Reset Supplies
mypack.quest558.desc=Use these to get back up to speed.
mypack.quest559.name=Keeping Track
mypack.quest559.desc=Agricraft is a mod about breeding seeds together to develop new seeds and mutating seeds to increase their stats. Basic unmutated seeds take a while to grow, are prone to being destroyed by weeds, and have a yield of only one or two crops. By increasing the strength, gain, and growth stats you can improve all of these features.
mypack.quest560.name=Aquaculture
mypack.quest560.desc=It is advised that you start a basic farm ASAP, since you will need a balanced diet to stay healthy, not to mention a lot of corn for Ethanol.
mypack.quest561.name=The Moist-maker
mypack.quest561.desc=Using a sprinkler amongst your crops will speed their growth.  You will need to provide a water tank beneath it, which will slowly deplete after a while.  There is no need to go heavy on the crops and sprinklers just yet though, Agricraft will provide better options.
mypack.quest562.name=Analyze This
mypack.quest562.desc=The seed analyzer is a workstation that will identify the stats of any seeds that you breed or mutate. You can also place your Journal into the slot of the analyzer in order to receive additional information in your Journal about those seeds.
mypack.quest563.name=A Load of Crop
mypack.quest563.desc=Cropsticks play a vital role in your farming operation.   At least a single set of crop-sticks are required for all harvestcraft seeds to grow.. Two sets of crop-sticks on the same plot is called a cross-crop. Cross-crops have  a chance to §1duplicate a plant if only one is adjacent;  §4breed a plant with increased stats if two of the same plants are adjacent;  §5or mutate a new plant type if two different parent plants are adjacent. §rMutation combinations can be found in JEI.
mypack.quest564.name=Button Presser
mypack.quest564.desc=You don't have to hover over your dispenser pressing the button every few seconds to harvest the crops.  Make a Redstone Clock to pulse once per second, activating the dispenser as needed.
mypack.quest565.name=Weeds
mypack.quest565.desc=Weeds have a possibility of growing inside the plot of empty crop-sticks. if you break the weeds up by hand you will lose the crop-sticks, so use a rake to remove the weeds without destroying the crop-sticks. Keep a close eye on this process; weeds can spread to healthy plants over an extended period of time and destroy your crops.
mypack.quest566.name=Advance Crop Care
mypack.quest566.desc=There is a world of produce available at your fingertips.  Maintaining a varied and healthy diet can give you buffs such as constant night vision, depth strider, and other helpful status effects,  §1Mass producing farm goods to sell will be the best way to gain§1§r §1Gil currency.
mypack.quest567.name=Easy Access
mypack.quest567.desc=The Agricraft mod is the only means of access to many of the produce items you will need to strengthen your economy later in the pack.   §1Agricraft tools and irrigation systems require a particular infused wood that is only available in a place called Glacidus.\nTip:  Click the icon on the right to view the capsule recipe.
mypack.quest568.name=Fancy Named Wood
mypack.quest568.desc=The Glacidus has three layers.  The top, cold icey and hostile, with loot-filled dungeons.  The underground, a bit more peaceful, where you will find the §1Underground Trees needed for Agriculture. §rAnd the deep depths, a hellish area with ores that will be important later.  Getting from what layer to the next is as simple as digging downward.
mypack.quest569.name=Back To The Future Fashion
mypack.quest569.desc=One of the primary means of transportation of this Time Era are the famed Hoverboards.  These boards are all the rage with the kids these days.  Lets get you one of your own.  First, we need to locate a Magical Forest, as the Silverwood Trees and Shimmerleaf plants that grow under the Silverwood trees are a key ingredient.\n§6Tip: Plant a few Silverwood Saplings.  You will need a decent amount of their wood.
mypack.quest570.name=Rejuvenator Strikes Again
mypack.quest570.desc=Shimmerleaf Plants can be turned directly into Quicksilver, which can be hammered into Quicksilver Dust and smelted into Quicksilver Ingots.  The Shimmerleaf Plants are somewhat rare though.  §6Another way to obtain Quicksilver is by Rejuvenating the Silverwood logs themselves.
mypack.quest571.name=Its Hammer Time
mypack.quest571.desc=Smash the quicksilver pearls into a fine powder and smelt the dust into Quicksilver Ingots.  This low density compound is the perfect material to craft your Hoverboard.
mypack.quest572.name=Gliding On Thin Air
mypack.quest572.desc=The Hoverboard will prevent you from taking fall damage as you glide down from high cliffs and overhangs.  However, zipping to fast and slamming into a wall or ledge can inflict damage.  Be careful where you are going.
mypack.quest573.name=A Capacity For RF Storage
mypack.quest573.desc=Where you look is where you go.  Obviously you can stear your hoverboard by turning in the direction you want to go.  This also applies to ascending and descending.  If you are descending from a large height you will float at an angle... looking up will flatten your angle, while looking down will make it steeper.
mypack.quest574.name=Thruster Buster
mypack.quest574.desc=Two Hoverboard Thrusters will give your board upwards lift.  You can funnel additional power to the thrusters to launch off the ground and float a short distance. §6 Your HUD will show a power gauge that will fill up, indicating the strength of your "jump". §fTiming and controlling the hoverboard movement can take some practice.
mypack.quest575.name=Charged With Having Fun
mypack.quest575.desc=Your Hoverboard has a RF Capacity of 1000000, and will need to be recharged after extended use.  You do NOT want to run out of rf/t as you are floating down from a high cliff.
mypack.quest576.name=Have Faith In The Plates
mypack.quest576.desc=Your Hoverboard can travel over both Lava and Water.  This makes it the perfect tranportation for the Nether.
mypack.quest577.name=Multi-purpose Workbench
mypack.quest577.desc=You will need a Jetpack Workbench in order to make your Hoverboard.  This is obviously the same workbench you will use later in the pack to create your Jetpack.
mypack.quest578.name=Components Galore
mypack.quest578.desc=Your Hoverboard will be your main means for ground transportation.  It is much faster than a horse, and much more mobile than any other mount.  It will take some practice though, as gliding on air can be a bit tricky.
mypack.quest579.name=Power On The Go
mypack.quest579.desc=Make a Flux Capacitor to supplement your Hoverboard RF storage.  Shift Right Click it to allow it to charge items in your inventory.  Great for when you don't have access to a Chargepad on the go.
mypack.quest580.name=Lace Up!
mypack.quest580.desc=It's time to float on the clouds.  Put your hoverboard together and charge it up in a machine such as the Energetic Infuser.  Right click the board onto the ground to set it up, then right click it to mount on it and drive off!  §6Hold space bar to charge your thrusters for a jump.\n§cWarning: The charging of the hoverboards are WIP.  So you can ride for free until next patch :-)
mypack.quest581.name=Float Like A Butterfly
mypack.quest581.desc=You can break your Hoverboard with pickaxe to place it back in your inventory.  \n§6Tip: You will not take fire damage when hovering on Lava, but don't point the tip of your board down, or you will dip under the surface.
mypack.quest582.name=Mobile Infantry
mypack.quest582.desc=You can fire arrows, throw grenades, and swing your sword while on the Hoverboard.  It can take a bit of a punch before dismounting you, but if you allow a mob to knock you off the Hoverboard, it will stay floating at the location and altitude where you dismounted, waiting for you to retrieve it.
mypack.quest583.name=A Dangerous Proposition
mypack.quest583.desc=Spawning and farming Withers is a dangerous task.  They have an explosion mechanic that will destroy most machines that aren't protected.  The last thing you want is to have a breech in your system that lets Withers escape, so take the upmost precautions.
mypack.quest584.name=The Forcicium Is Strong
mypack.quest584.desc=Now its time to prepare a way to contain and kill the Withers you spawn.  §1Your Embers Quarry should have been pulling in Monazit ore§r, which can be smelted into Forcicium crystals.  If you find yourself burning through more crystals than your Embers Quarry is bringing in, §1you can also create crystals by tranposing Nutrient Distillation into Embers Crystals.
mypack.quest585.name=Staff Of Return
mypack.quest585.desc=While the teleportation platform can send you to other dimensions, the Rod of Return is your ticket back.  Shift+right click it on a telepad to link them.  It will teleport you back to that location when needed.  It does require rf/t AND Dew of the Void to operate.
mypack.quest586.name=Rod Of Return
mypack.quest586.desc=Your vat can make you additional Dew of The Void supplies.  Make sure not to get stranded in another dimension without any rf/t or Dew to power your Rod.
mypack.quest587.name=What're Thooooose?!
mypack.quest587.desc=Your Ender Armor has step assist and speed boosts... they dont float the boat for every player, so make sure to toggle them off if needed.
mypack.quest588.name=Ender Leggings
mypack.quest588.desc=Your Ender Armor also has a large built in inventory.  Again, check your keybinds to find out how to access this function.
mypack.quest589.name=Its Simply A Jetpack
mypack.quest589.desc=The Ender Jetplate is a combination of great protection and flight capabilities.  Not unlike the other pieces of armor, it will require rf/t to function, however, the keybindings for this piece wikll be found under the Simply Jetpack category.  There are functions such as Emergency Hover available.\n§1Tip: If, for some reason, you don't want the Jetplate version of the Ender chest, there is a non flight capable version as well.
mypack.quest590.name=Customizing Your Field
mypack.quest590.desc=The size, position, and type of forcefield you project are controlled by the different upgrades you place into the projector GUI.  The §1Focus upgrades will expand the field on the X and Y axes§r... basically making your field wider. §2The Field Strength Upgrade will expand your field on the Z axis§r, giving it depth, and creating a cube when used with the Focus Upgrades.  §4The Distance upgrades control how far in front of the projector your forcefield starts.
mypack.quest591.name=Anchors Up
mypack.quest591.desc=Travel Anchors will also allow you to teleport between them without the Staff of Travelling if the two anchors are within 50 blocks of each other.
mypack.quest592.name=Project Projection
mypack.quest592.desc=The Projector is the heart of the MFFS system, it is the block that actually projects your forcefield into the world.  It has a somewhat complicated GUI, so refer to this handy guide for further details.  The Projector needs to be linked to the Capacitor like other machines, using a blank  MFFS card.
mypack.quest593.name=Fighting Back
mypack.quest593.desc=The Ender Sword and Bow are the strongest weapons you will find... if you mean to confront every meanie that comes along your journey, then you will need this pair to do it with.\n\nThe Ender Mk2 also has a high beheading chance.
mypack.quest594.name=Dimensional Transceiver
mypack.quest594.desc=The Dimensional Transceiver is a wireless and cross-dimensional way to transport energy, fluids, and items.  The GUI will allow you to set up channels, which are linked between any other Transceivers set to that same channel.  This will be very important in setups going forward, including your Wither farm.
mypack.quest595.name=Enderoomba
mypack.quest595.desc=The Vacuum Chest will suck items within huge 24 block radius into it's buffer.  Works great for mob farms where explosions aren't a factor.
mypack.quest596.name=Creative Storage Cell
mypack.quest596.desc=Infinite storage space.
mypack.quest597.name=Creative Satchel
mypack.quest597.desc=Infinite number of any one item.
